### Title should be summary
Hi, the title of a question should be a one-sentence summary of what the code does. Please change it accordingly, and also read our [how-to-ask](/help/how-to-ask) page, which explains this aspect, and more.

### Not an answer - blatantly garbage
This is not an answer. It doesn't review the code in the question. Please take the [tour](http://$SITEURL/tour) to understand how to use this site properly.

### Not an answer - insufficient explanation
This is not an answer. We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context. Don't just give a one-line answer; explain why your answer is right, ideally with citations. Answers that don't include explanations may be removed.

### Not an answer - insufficient justification
This is not an answer. We are looking for answers that provide insightful observations about the code in the question. Answers that consist of independent solutions with no justification do not constitute a code review, and may be removed.

### Way off-topic
I'm deleting this question because it doesn't look like you're anywhere near posting working code, which is required here. Please see the [on-topic](http://$SITEURL$/help/on-topic) page in the help center to understand what kind of questions are appropriate here.

### Broken code
It seems your code is not working as intended, which is off-topic here. Please read the [on-topic](http://$SITEURL$/help/on-topic) page in the help center.

### Add intro paragraph
Hi, as your question starts with a block of code instead of regular text, on the [front page](http://$SITEURL$/questions) it shows up with "..." as the summary. That's not very attractive to reviewers. It would be better to add a nice introductory paragraph that briefly explains what the code does. See also [this meta post](http://meta.codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/2436/how-to-get-the-best-value-out-of-code-review-asking-questions) to make the most out of asking questions here.

### Question off-topic
I'm afraid this question does not match what this site is about. $SITENAME$ is about improving existing, working code. $SITENAME$ is not the site to ask for help in fixing or changing *what* your code does. Once the code does what you want, we would love to help you do the same thing in a cleaner way! Please see our [on-topic](/help/on-topic) page for more information.

### Question asking for feature
I'm afraid this question does not match what this site is about. $SITENAME$ is about improving existing, working code. $SITENAME$ is not the site to ask for help for implementing missing features. Once you have the code working the way you want, we would love to help you improve it. Please see our [on-topic](/help/on-topic) for more details.

### Challenge description linked but not included
Links can rot. [Please include a description of the challenge here in your question.](http://meta.codereview.stackexchange.com/q/1993/41243)

### Question contains code, but hidden behind a link
Unfortunately your question is off-topic as of now, as the code to be reviewed must be [present in the question.](http://meta.codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/1308) Code behind links is considered non-reviewable. Please add the code you want reviewed in your question.

### Rolled back due to answers invalidated
I rolled back your edit to the code in the question, as your changes invalidate some of the answers. [What you may and may not do after receiving answers](http://meta.codereview.stackexchange.com/a/1765)

### Answer lacks description
Please explain your reasoning (how your solution works and how it improves upon the original) so that the author can learn from your thought process.
